# The Wheat Free Biscuit Review

I spent three weeks eating a wheat-free diet to see if it would help my Eczema. It didn't! Note that's *wheat free*, not gluten free, because apparently wheat specifically can affect eczema.


## Background

I'm a big biscuit fan (that's cookies for the internationals) and thought these would be the hardest thing to go without, so I bought quite a lot different biscuits to try out the whole field. Imagining that this diet might go on for the rest of my life, I thought I should make a note of the costs as well, to find an affordable everyday biscuit.

I usually have two or three biscuits in the work day, with coffee or after lunch. My favourites are chocolate hobnob-like biscuits (Asda's own brand particularly), and bourbons. I always prefer biscuits with chocolate or chocolate chips. I am a relatively thin and physically fit person.


## Results

### Tesco Free From - Chocolate Chip Cookies

£1.30 for 12 cookies (145g total) = 10.8p per biscuit
I like these, there's not much difference from actual Maryland-style cookies. Good dunkers. Not dusty. A nice rounded flavour and good chocolateyness in the chips. I would buy these again but as a 1-a-day treat, because I think we can go cheaper. Priced from a Tesco Extra superstore.


### Nairn's Biscuit Breaks - Oats & Chocolate Chip

£1.95 for 16 biscuits (160g total) = 12.2p per biscuit
These are an elongated shape. Good for dipping. Slightly dusty in texture, and salty in flavour, in a hobnob kind of way. Insufficiently chocolatey. Very thin and small compared to mass market biscuits. Priced from a Sainsbury's Local - probably cheaper in a superstore.


### Schar Bourbon Biscuit

£1.65 for 10 biscuits (125g) = 16.5p per biscuit
These are the real lo-light of the experiment; they are rubbish. Schar's bourbons taste nothing like a mass market bourbon, they are weirdly soft, cheesy, and expensive. The texture and flavour are both awful. They are smaller than regular bourbons and come in silly bags of two inside the box. Outrageously, the back of the box suggests you might want to crumble them up to make the base of a bourbon cheesecake. What, are we *made* of money?!


### Nairn's Dark Chocolate Chip Oat Biscuits 

£1.35 - 20 biscuits (200g) - 6.7p per biscuit
Pretty good, a bit dark and bitter. I actually wonder whether the factory batch I bought was slightly burnt. Small and thin like their elognated Nairn's counterparts (above) and not as sweet. Great value and not too bad for dipping, they would make a fairly suitable everyday biscuit. Price from Tesco Extra superstore.


### Tesco Finest Free From - Triple Chocolate Cookies

£1.85 - 8 biscuits () - 23.1p per biscuit
These are a really nice treat. They have some of the soft, dustiness associated with gluten free, but actually hold together well because of how chocolatey they are. Luxurious dunking biscuits to go with milky tea especially. They're backed in chocolate, have a chocolate flavour, and chocolate chips (hence triple). Twice the price-per-biscuit of the other competitors, but worth it. Price from Tesco Extra superstore.


## Conclusion

Out of the biscuits and cookies I tried, my lineup would be:

 + **Regular biscuit:** Nairn's Dark Chocolate Chip Oat Biscuits (6.7p)
 + **One-a-day:** Tesco Free From - Chocolate Chip Cookies (10.8p)
 + **Special treat:** Tesco Finest Free From - Triple Chocolate Cookies
