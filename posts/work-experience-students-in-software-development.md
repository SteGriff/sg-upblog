# Work experience students in software development

Over the years at Village Software we've taken in a variety of work experience students from high schools and colleges for 1-2 weeks, ranging in ages from 15 to 18, with hugely varying levels of skill and enthusiasm. Here are some observations:

## The one that wasn't interested in programming or, well, work

The most challenging of these students are those that have been randomly assigned to VS based on the subjects they're taking, but don't have any real desire or excitement about visiting a real software company.

We had one young man, a year 10, who didn't have an skills applicable to helping with our day-to-day, so we gave him fun learning tasks to carry out. Having some experience of Python, we let him loose with our Python-driven robotic arm, giving him the challenge of picking up an object from one place and putting it down in another. He did the minimum he possibly could to meet the brief and then openly reverted to watching videos, browsing social media, and generally doing millenial stuff. There was no curiousity about "what could I make it do next".

This began a challenging fortnight of finding ways to keep this guy entertained. I personally spent a few hours with him finding out what he was into and helping him to learn the basics of how to make a game, after which we started creating a fake MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena [or in our case, more accurately, a BA]) to his design. The same thing happened as with the robot arm - there was a lack of enthusiasm and drive to expand upon the game except for the tasks I specifically suggested.

Basically, this guy was not going to be a programmer, and he probably didn't want to be. The other unfortunate thing was that he hadn't yet developed much of a work ethic. So this was a bad experience for us, as a drain on time which didn't really give anything beneficial back to the student. This bad assignment (by the school) was a waste of everyone's time.

## The good worker lacking skills

We took on a college first-year for two weeks who was driven and ready and willing to help. Great! The main obstacle with this guy was that he didn't yet have any solid programming skills. As it happened, his SQL was one of his strongest abilities, and we managed to find a number of ways that he could improve our timesheet reporting toolchain. So he had a few days of productive work improving these things to provide better insights into how well staff had filled out their timesheets.

After this, we ran a bit short of work that he could do without a 5-hour primer. And this was kind of sad, because he was a guy who wanted to work, we just couldn't affordably get him doing on anything. So really, we need somebody with esttablished Object Oriented Programming skills, whether Java, C#, or some other language.

## The prodigy

Probably our best experience was another guy in first year of college, who was massively talented. He had a clear interest in software and programming, and had actually self elected to come to our work *during his holiday*, not at the behest of school. That's a good signal to start with. Anyway, having impressive acumen not just in C# but in problem solving and computational thinking, he fit right into some actual project work, and development and advancement of a number of our internal tools such as the UDP caller display we developed for our phone system.

It was easy to hand work over to him after short explanations, and we got him set up effectively in JIRA, further reducing the time to start a task, because he was pretty dilligent about reading a problem description and figuring it out for himself. He also made a fairly good pair programmer, asking intelligent questions (as well as some distracting ones which nevertheless betrayed an immense appetite for learning).

My only regret was not having the time and attention I would have liked to spend with this guy and coach him. I hope he works for us in the future!

## Notes

We've not had any female work experience placements despite having a 40% female workforce (which is very high for tech). I put this down to:

 * The greater chance of boys putting themselves forward for tech placement
 * More encouragement on boys to do so
 * Lack of encouragement for girls to put themselves forward for tech
 * Girls in general being less likely to self-promote compared to boys (as studies have shown)
 
Also, we don't advertise for work experience placements, we are approached in 100% of cases, either by the school or the individual.

Lastly, why don't work experience students make tea and go to fetch things any more? I remember being constantly busy in my year 10 work ex, photocopying, creating lesson resources, taking bins out, cleaning and vacuuming, making tea and coffee, going to the shops, sending group texts and emails, making phone calls, writing databases... I don't think that's just me, I think expectations of work ex are different. Expect (and volunteer) to make tea! It's a great lesson in humility!
